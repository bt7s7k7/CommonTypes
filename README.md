A collection of various utility functions you have to rewrite every time you need them. Also contains additional data structures. The code is written to be as easy to understand as possible, not necessarily the most performant. The library is fully written in TypeScript and includes types.

Contains such functions as `escapeHTML`, `convertCase`, `binarySearch`, `lerpNumber` or `reverseIndexOf`. For full documentation refer to the source code. 

Data structures:
  - Graph
  - Linked List
  - Multi Map
  - Sorted Array
